Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru was my favourite leader.

He was one of the greatest statesmen of his age. 
He was born on 14th November, 1889 at Allahabad. 
His father was Pt. Moti Lal Nehru.
He was a great barrister.
Jawahar Lal was the only son of his parents. 
He was brought up like a prince amidst riches. 
He was sent to England for higher studies. 
Having finished his education there, he returned to India and became a lawyer. 
When he came in touch with Mahatma Gandhi he became his disciple. 
He was fond of children. 
They called him, "Chacha Nehru". 
That is why his birthday is celebrated as the "Children Day". 
He fought for the cause of the poor. 
He died on 27th May, 1964. 
India lost a great son and a leader in him.
